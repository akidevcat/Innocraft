  # This is the authentication server.
  # In case you have a dedicated authentication server and SecurityMaster is installed only there,
  # you can specify this server and it will disable all authentication checks on other servers.
  # Keep in mind, that these 'other' servers should be inaccessible without joining the auth server.
  # If you don't have an authentication server, you can comment this line.
